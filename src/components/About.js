      <p>Hi! I&apos;m Wise, a web dveloper.</p>

      <p>
        As a musician, I&apos;ve noticed many similarities between learning an instrument and
        learning to program. Both teach you lessons in starting small and progressing incrementally.
        There's no limit to what you can accomplish; people are constantly pushing the boundaries of
        what we thoguth was possible both creatively and technically.

        Learning web development has been challenging but extremely rewardng. With music, it's
        exciting to be able to think of a melody in my head and then play it instantly. In web
        development, I've been able to do the same. I can think of ideas for projects, and bring
        them to life.
